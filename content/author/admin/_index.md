Before joining Bytedance, she got her Ph.D. degree from Peking University, adviced by Prof. [Xu Sun](https://xusun.org/).  Her research focuses on green machine learning (namely efficient). She has published over ten  papers on top-tier conferences, including NeurIPS, ICML, ACL, and EMNLP, with cumulative 700 citations. Her work on green deep learning has been selected on AAAI-2020 New Faculty Highlights. She has served as ACL 2021 Area Chair. She has great interests on IoT applicatinos. Currently, she works on tiny models for NLP applications."

I am a PhD candidate, supervised by Prof. Xu Sun, at MOE Key Laboratory of Computational Linguistics, School of Electronics Engineering and Computer Science, Peking University. I received the degree of Bachelor of College of Information Engineering from Northwest A&F University in 2015. 

I have great interests in Natural Language Processing and Deep Learning. Currently, my research areas include **knowledge-aware language understanding and generation, adversarial attack for robust machine learning**.
